**Please give a one-sentence summary of the feature you would like to see.**

E.g. "we should be able to give nicknames to other Rocket 2 users."

E.g. "every user should be able to have an arbitrary number of nicknames, and users should be able to give each other nicknames."

For instance, if this was requested by a Launch Pad president, if it has been discussed somewhere else like Slack, etc.
E.g. "nicknames are required for the new website."
